# About files
- `vision_3yp_MAIN_program.ipynb` is the main Python notebook that I wrote my training and testing script in. 
- `Link to Trained Vision Model (161MB)` is a link to my Google Drive to download the trained model. Unable to upload on Github due to size restrictions
- `labels_test.csv` and `labels_train_val.csv` are pandas dataframes necessary for interpreting the classes and bounding boxes of the training and test dataset. 
- `training_results_log.txt` contains the full log of the training process, including metrics like loss, precision, and recall.
- `vision` is a folder containing supporting files, cloned from the torch git repo
